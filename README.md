# TravelTide Customer Segmentation Project

## Project Overview
This project develops a customer segmentation strategy for TravelTide, a travel agency, aimed at enhancing email marketing through personalized perks. By analyzing session-level data (with sessions after January 4, 2023 and users with more than 7 sessions) and applying a hybrid segmentation approach—combining rule-based filtering and hierarchical clustering—we identified distinct customer segments and assigned tailored perks to each group.
